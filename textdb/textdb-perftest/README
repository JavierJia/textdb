NOTE: Don't remove the file named .gitignore in any directory! 

Step 1-Prepare Data Set:

By default, there is a small data set named "abstract_100.txt" in ./data-files/.
If you want to get results from more data sets, please put the data files into ./data-files/. 

More data sets can be found at:
https://github.com/TextDB/textdb/wiki/Data-Sets
 
Step 2-Prepare Index:
In order to write index, run WriteIndex.java file in edu.uci.ics.textdb.perftest.run package.
NOTE: Once index is created, it can be reused (no writing index needed in the future)!!!!
		However, if you make changes to your data set(s), writing index is still needed.

Step 3-Prepare Queries:
By default, there is a sample query file named "sample_queries.txt" in ./data-files/queries/.
These queries are used in all operator performance tests except regexmatcher.
The default regex queries are defined in RunPerftests.java.

If you are satisfied with the default queries, then move onto Step 4.

If you want to use your own queries, please put query files to ./data-files/queries/ 
or change the regex queries listed in RunPerftests.java.
In RunPerftests.java, you can see some operator performance tests take in a query file as a parameter.
Please change the query file name to the one you want.
 
Step 4-Run Performance Tests:
In order to run the performance tests, please run RunPerftests.java file in edu.uci.ics.textdb.perftest.run package.

Step 5-Review Test Results:
Performance test results can be found in the corresponding folders in ./data-files/results/.
For example, test results for dictionary matcher can be found in ./data-files/results/queries/.
